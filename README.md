# TODOs:

I think the whole `VocabGroup` should be removed. Each word should belong to a language.
Each word pair can have tags, and you can filter by tags.
Each tag has a colour, similar to vocab group colour

You can search by tags, and also group by tags. Group by uses the same UI (book items) as vocab groups do currently
